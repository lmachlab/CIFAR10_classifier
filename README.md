# CIFAR-10 image classifier

This project classifies images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, and shows the
relationship between accuracy and the number of convolutional layers in 
a convolutional neural network (CNN) as well as the number of epochs trained.

The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 images from 10 classes. Classes
include: plane, car, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck
